Hi, I'm Jess. 

- I like french fries and coffee. Neither mail well. 
- I love my doggo. 
- I'm probably outside.


Apoligies for the mess. This is a no frills site. I have spent the past few years telling myself that I will build a beautiful site that I like and magical systems that work for reducing the friction between me and writing. And yet, what I have done is....not write. This site will remain this boring until at least April 1, 2022. This is my public commitment to not do anything until that time besides, write.
