**Today's Progress**:
+ I designed another application to help our homeschooled kids. I've only mapped it out, but it is much less complicated than the Travel application that I am developing, so I think it will go fairly quickly.
+ I spent a little time adding a navigation controller to the modal item view.

**Thoughts**: An hour is not enough to get much done on an application. 

**Link to work**: None to show
