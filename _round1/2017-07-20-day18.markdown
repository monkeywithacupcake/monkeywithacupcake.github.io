**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 15 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved an algorithm, so my algorithm rank is now *75845*, better than yesterday (*77499*).
+ Finished **Day 3 of Week of Code 34** also on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com). Blargh. My functions timed out on most of the test cases. Not sure how to improve them, and I can't post the code because it is a challenge.  
+ Improved the operation of the 4 color themes and added changeable icons for each hat for my Hats iOS application.
+ Read Ch 11 of [Clean Code by Robert Martin](http://amzn.to/2sOXBuy).
+ Began working on the Weather Application for [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). (code below) 
+ Fixed the button overlap issue on my Magic Quote Machine that someone commented on. The solution was to give the border a different color than the buttons so that they did not appear to touch when pushed on separate rows in small screens. Another solution could be to remove the words when the screen is small and just leave the icons.

**Thoughts**: Repeating myself from yesterday...geesh - I am still writing slow loopy code, but it is improving everytime I have a timeout on Hacker Rank.
