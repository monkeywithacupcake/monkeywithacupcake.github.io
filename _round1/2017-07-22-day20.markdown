**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 17 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved a couple of algorithms, so my algorithm rank is now *65004*, quite a bit better than yesterday (*75845*).
+ Tried the problems in the **Moody's Analytics Women in Engineering Hackathon** also on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com). I am kicking myself for not realizing that this was only for today. I made it through 3 of 5 challenges, and I'm not ranked too badly for just jumping into this stuff. Lack of true love for recursive functions and my slow loopy approaches are still weaknesses that I need to tackle if I want to win one in the future.
+ Worked on the Weather Application for [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). It now gets the weather and displays one of three icons (cloud, rain, or sun). Not working yet: change from C to F (I have a switch but it doesn't work yet) and get the color change to work.  (code below) 

**Thoughts**: I am happy to make progress on these applications. The challenges help me learn new skills that improve my thinking for the things that I want to do.
