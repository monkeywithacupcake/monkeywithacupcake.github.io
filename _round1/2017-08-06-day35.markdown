**Today's Progress**:
+ Did a front end algorithm on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com); now I am on challenge 277. 
+ My [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) algorithm rank today is *22,354*, a little better than yesterday (*23,236*) because I solved an algorithm. 

**Thoughts**: I spent almost the entire day out of the house and only coded on free code camp and Hacker Rank today (besides updating this log).

**Link to work**: None today
