**Today's Progress**:
+ I created a new test calendar app project in swift so that I could test out some ideas for interactive calendars to incorporate in other apps. I chose to do it separate from the main apps, so that I can just focus on the calendar. 
+ I figured out that the process (for most of my apps) requires four steps before actually editing the workspace
    1. Create a new Xcode project
    2. Use the project bundle id to set up a firebase project (if using)
    3. Close the new project and open terminal
    4. Initialize and update a podfile: 
        + within terminal, navigate to folder, type ``` pod init ```
        + edit the new podfile with any pods, like Firebase or JTAppleCalendar
        + install required pods ``` pod install ```

**Thoughts**:  I did a tiny celebration this morning when I started the MyCalendar app and had forgotten to select (use Git) but was still able to figure out how to create a new repository for my fledgling app. I'm gaining confidence with git by forcing myself to do this project.
