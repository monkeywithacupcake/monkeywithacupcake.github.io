**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 13 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved another algorithm today, so my algorithm rank is now *77393*, better than yesterday (*83151*).
+ Completed the first Intermediate Front End Development project on [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). Iâ€™m currently at challenge 256.  
+ Came up with a new list of improvements for my Hats iOS application.
+ Read Ch 9 of [Clean Code by Robert Martin](http://amzn.to/2sOXBuy).

**Thoughts**: Javascript always seemed unnecessary for what I wanted to do, but that must have been some kind of wishful thinking. Javascript substantially improves functionality for the ideas that I have.
