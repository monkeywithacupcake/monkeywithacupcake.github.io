**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 19 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved an algorithm, so my algorithm rank is now *60628*, better than yesterday (*63805*). 
+ ~Started the Wikipedia application for [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). I spent 2 hours trying to figure out how to solve the [object Error]{} I'm getting when trying to print the output of the wikipedia api response.~ Came back to the problem after working on some other tasks, and it is working now.  (code below) 

**Thoughts**: ~I will try the wikipedia thing again tomorrow.~ I will build the Twitch.tv JSON challenge tomorrow.
