**Today's Progress**:
+ Read the rest of Ch 7 of [Clean Code by Robert Martin](http://amzn.to/2sOXBuy). 
+ Finished **Day 9 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com). I also solved one more implementation algorithm today, so my algorithm rank is now *127846*, still improving (*I was at 136019 yesterday*). I hit a real wall today because I could not figure out how to optimize a recursive function. 
+ Did a few more Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges in [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). Iâ€™m currently at challenge 244.  
+ Began working through some issues that I found when testing my iOS apps on my phone. 

**Thoughts**: I need to get more practice thinking through algorithm challenges so that I write more optimized code. I do human type thinking programming too often, and it is slow.
