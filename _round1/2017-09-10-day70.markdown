**Today's Progress**:
+ started a clean new version of the travel app to pull all of the pieces together.
+ created a twitter poll to determine the app name
+ purchased relevant domain names
+ created a github page for the app

**Thoughts**:  I switched back to swift because I really, really want to finish my group travel app. I want to get back to reactjs, but I have to publish this app.

**Link to work**: none today
