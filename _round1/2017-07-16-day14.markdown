**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 11 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved some sorting and string algorithms today, so my algorithm rank is now *83041*, which is better than yesterday (*128046*).
+ Completed the rest of Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges in [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). Iâ€™m currently at challenge 248. Since I spent a lot of time today on sorting functions, I chose not to jump into JSON and Ajax today. 
+ Read Ch 8 of [Clean Code by Robert Martin](http://amzn.to/2sOXBuy). 

**Thoughts**: I really dug into sorting functions today, learning about different reasons to go with algorithms based on the parameters of the goal. Every time I dig deep into the theory behind functions, I understand a little bit more about the limitations of brute force approaches and benefits of elegant code. That "useless" numerical methods class is starting to seem relevant.
