**Today's Progress**:
+ Started working on the calculator project for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
+ Worked on some bash tutorials in [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) - it's amazing how much more I can do with terminal than I have been. Didn't realize it, but there is a rank for BASH, too (just like algorithms). I don't know what I started out at, but I'm at 20,550 now...and I have a whopping 11 points. 


**Thoughts**:  I did a tiny bit of iOS programming in XCode 9 Beta, but I was trying to work on it while outside (between things), and it really did not work for me. I just had to walk around and explore. Lesson learned - I'll do my coding inside.
