**Today's Progress**:
+ iOS dev: I spent most of the day working through the concepts that I needed to understand for a calendar:
    + making a button to return to or scroll to a specific date
    + showing the events in a particular calendar when the day is clicked
    + indicating a free day
    + indicating a busy day

**Thoughts**:  I feel empowered since I solved a design problem and a git problem today.
