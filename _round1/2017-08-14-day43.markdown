**Today's Progress**:
+ Added buttons to the Calculator for current Front End Challenge on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
+ Finished an anagram challenge on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) 
+ Made more progress on the instagram clone app that I'm making with [Code with Chris](https://codewithchris.com)
+ Used my learnings from the instagram clone app to reset the login process for my group travel app for iOS. This is actually so close to what I started with that I'm surprised I hadn't already set it up this way. I think the modal presentation will be smoother for the user, and there are fewer lines of code for me.

**Thoughts**: I am learning quite a bit from the codepen projects for Free Code Camp and for the Daily CSS images, but at the same time, they are parallel learnings to my primary code task - the travel app. I'm tempted to focus on just the swift work, but I think the exposure to more algorithms and use cases helps me to think about my projects from more perspectives.
