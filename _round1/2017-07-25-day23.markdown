**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 20 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved an algorithm, so my algorithm rank is now *49514*, better than yesterday (*60628*). I made a little bet with myself that I could get to better than rank 50k today. 
+ Built the Twitch.tv application for [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). I enjoyed the problem of this task, but I have never used twitch, and it stopped loading while I was making the app, so I'm not super impressed with the media. (code below). Also -> finished with Intermediate Front End Development Projects...back to algorithms.

**Thoughts**: I need to box this progress into a smaller part of my day. It's enjoyable, but I need to do other stuff. I may begin limiting these tasks to < 2 hours per day.
