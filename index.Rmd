Jess Chandler is a data scientist and energy policy enthusiast currently focused on exploring lots of new projects. Her research focuses on sustainable communities and measuring welfare. So far, it has been a lot of acknowledging that we don't have a good track record of measuring what really matters. 

Life being what it is, she has spent most of her career analyzing businesses by day, and fitting in the research in the wee hours. Along the way, she's traveled and enjoyed many lovely places in the world. Jess can be found these days running around the PNW. Probably feeding birds.
