**Today's Progress**:
+ Did a bunch of additional admin on the Travel Together development and support site to ensure it was showing at traveltogetherapp.com instead of only from github.io.
+ Worked on coding the Travel Together App


**Thoughts**: I underestimated how long it would take to pull the working but disparate pieces together.
