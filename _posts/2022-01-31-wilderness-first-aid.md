I spent this weekend freezing learning Wilderness First Aid. I say freezing, but I was not actually freezing, just cold. We had to keep the doors open for ventilation since there were so many strangers in a room together all day.

We covered so many injuries that you are used to from first aid classes - cuts, bruises, broken bones...but also the ones that we are going to see out in the wild - like altitude sickness and also stomach bugs. We practiced creating splints from found items and talked through what to do when you can't help in the moment. 

I think one of the things this class imparted on me was the importance of staying safe in the wild. Rescue is not coming. Your beacon is for closure for your loved ones. This is pretty grim, but it is reality. It is a pleasure and gift to be able to get into the wilderness; getting back out is your own responsibility. Packing for a few likely injuries is a good practice. You can't take the weight to be prepared for all emergencies, though. 

I really enjoyed how the instructors made the course interactive - setting us up with scripts and simulated injuries to practice helping people who are struggling. I hope to never use these skills - my fervent hope every time that I take a first aid class - and I am glad that I have the practice.
