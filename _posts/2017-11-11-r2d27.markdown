I thought I didn't spend much time coding today, but then I reviewed my logs, and I got 4.5 hours in today with code and logs. That's pretty good considering I got to go on a fun glass blowing adventure and popped in to a neighbor's party.

## Today's Progress
+ I attempted to copy the canned code from Branch.io to make a link generate in my app. No dice. I know this is a super short bullet point, but I tried doing it six ways from Sunday...and they all basically boil down to this.

## Thoughts  
**Coders are not antisocial weirdos** I keep meeting kind, creative, considerate, sharing people in the coding community. I love these people. They make all the crazy worth it.

## Link to work
Not today.
