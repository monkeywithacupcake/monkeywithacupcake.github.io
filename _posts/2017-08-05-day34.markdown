**Today's Progress**:
+ I spent some time learning about [pug - a preprocessor for html](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html). It's pretty fantastic, and I think it will make pure css art codepens quite a bit cleaner. 
+ Did a couple more intermediate front end algorithms on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com); now I am on challenge 276. 
+ My [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) algorithm rank today is *23,236*, a little better than yesterday (*26,419*) because I solved a couple of algorithms. I spent some time trying to understand how to quickly build suffix arrays, but that is a problem for another day. I'm also chewing on this longest subsequence problem because I am not able to pass the timing test for the last few test cases [Discussion on Wikipedia of Longest Common Subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)

**Thoughts**: Even though I'm not a natural artist, I was a little bummed that the daily CSS images is only on weekdays.

**Link to work**: None today
