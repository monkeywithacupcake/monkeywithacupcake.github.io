**Today's Progress**:
+ Worked on the pomodoro timer for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
+ Two algorithms down for [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com)  - Got a super exciting 76th percentile Algorithms badge. I've now finished 70 algorithms challenges.  ![Algorithm badge](/images/HRalgorithmbadge76.png){:class="img-responsive"}
+ Working on updating group and individual auth info on firebase from iOS

**Thoughts**: Can't wait to apply learnings with javascript, css, and other libraries to be able to share more data analysis on the web.
