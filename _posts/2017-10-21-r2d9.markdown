## Today's Progress
+ I finished development of a website for my artsy talented kiddo. He still has to update the actual projects.

Here's the main page:

And this is one of the posts:

## Thoughts  
**Some things just take time** It took me about 2 hours of solid work to find my error from yesterday and another few hours to rebuild everything and get it all online. I consistently think that I can do things quickly once I find the errors or figure out the next steps, but typing and checking/validating just takes time.
