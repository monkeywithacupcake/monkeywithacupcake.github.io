**Today's Progress**:
+ I made progress in the iOS instagram clone.

**Thoughts**:   I spent some time trying to understand how ecommerce sites are set up. The security requirements are beyond me. I'm forcibly not learning that right now. I'll rely on existing companies to take care of online security and shopping for any development that I want to do in that area.

**Link to work**: None today.
