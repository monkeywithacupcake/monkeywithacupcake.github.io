**Today's Progress**:
+ Joined the #100DaysofCode challenge and posted on twitter my short lament about not starting 99 days ago. It’s like the real life fulfillment of that quote, “A year from now, you will have wished you started today.” 
+ Began working on challenges in [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org)  so that I can certify to help nonprofits with coding needs. So far, I am just flying through some simple HTML and CSS, but it is required for the front end development certification…which is also required for being able to help any non-profits. In my mind, this just means that I need to set aside 30 minutes per day to make progress on it. 
+ Continued working on development of my group travel application for iOS. I am trying to rethink how I set up my model and access/change data in line with clean code principles. To do this, I completed a tutorial on raywenderlich.com for showing some album covers. I was able to convert everything to the current version of Swift except for the file saving, which is not important for my project. I am going to apply some of the same fundamental design methods to keep from 1) memory leaks and 2) repeated code.

**Thoughts**: What a day.
