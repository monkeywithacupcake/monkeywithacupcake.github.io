Today, we discovered a chipmunk in one of our mouse traps in the garage.

**A Chipmunk**

We never expected this to happen, and both of us were a little broken up about it. 

I checked, and our Townsend's chipmunks are not endangered, so that is a little good news, I guess.

The really terrible part. The really terrible part is that tonight, there was another chipmunk, just sitting on a rock in our front yard, calling. I internalized it as calling for its friend, and I told it that its friend was dead. It went into the woods. Of course, it could have been letting its friends know that a predator (me) was around and then ran off to save itself. I don't actually know.

Anyways, so I'm feeling bad about the chipmunk.

_A note to people who like mice: I also like mice. I feel bad for the mouse families, too. Thankfully, we don't catch that many. The chipmunk just threw us for a loop. We had really not expected it to go for the trap._
