**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished *Day 26 of 30daysofCode* on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com). My algorithm rank today is *35,270*. I am currently stuck on how to speed up a count of shifts in an insertion sort - I'm using a binary inversion tree but still timing out on some test cases.
+ Broke [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) with whatever I did on Challenge 271. I sent an email. Hopefully, it is fixable. 
+ Finally made progress with updating the css over a jekyll theme. Moved my 100 Days of Code log from Github repo to github.io site. I had been following different jekyll documentation on this for days and was going a little crazy. It turns out that I was very close. For minima, I needed to have a file called `assets/main.scss` in the base folder for the site, like the example below. Some documentation said it should be in `assets/css/` and others had other locations or said it should be .scss. It was all very frustrating. However, it works splendidly now. I will work on updating the footer next.

{% highlight css %}

#main.css

@import "minima";

body {
  margin: 50px;
  margin-bottom: 60px;
  background-color: #EEEBD3;
  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(to right, #EEEBD3, #f7c59f ); /* Chrome 10-25, Safari 5.1-6 */
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #EEEBD3, #f7c59f ); /* W3C, IE 10+/ Edge, Firefox 16+, Chrome 26+, Opera 12+, Safari 7+ */
  color: #3a7f57;
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Thoughts**: I really like the simplicity and clean screen working with markdown rather than html for sites.
