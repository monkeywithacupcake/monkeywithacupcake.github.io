## Today's Progress
+ Recreated Crushing It application from scratch to get through some conversion to swift 4 errors. This is an application that I made to track things that you want to do for a certain number of times.
+ Pushed out another little gist after I struggled with some layout and did not want to use the storyboard. My searches on Stack Overflow suggested that other folks had the same issues. 
+ I started working on a website for my artsy talented kiddo. Got stuck on some jekyll crazyness.

## Thoughts  
**Code can bring joy** My younger kiddo sat with me and found out that you don't have to be some kind of a genius to do really cool stuff with code. I was so happy to see him light up when he realized that he had the power to: change the font, change the color, etc. Really simple stuff that is the kind of control that gets us all excited. So, even though I was feeling stuck and not sure why I was breaking things, he reminded me that it is really fun...and that is why we code.
