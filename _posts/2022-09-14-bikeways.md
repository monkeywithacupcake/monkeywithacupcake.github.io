I keep getting annoyed by the same thing. Once you see it, you can't stop seeing it. 

Bike lanes don't connect. 

Bike routes don't separate cyclists from the cars.

So, many communities have "bike routes" that are published - probably to attract some kind of vacation or touring cyclists. But, these routes are not serviceable for the local population. They are only useful for hardcore cyclists - people who ride a lot are confident _and maybe a little crazy_. 

The bike routes don't go between residential and commercial zoned areas. They go *through* commercial centers or follow the highway not touching commercial or residential zones. 

Who are these bikeways for?

Who is paying for them?

Why does it feel so lonely calling out this disconnect?
