**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 25 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com). I didn't even look at my algorithm rank today.
+ Finished Clean Code by Robert Martin - I liked the first part of the book better than the last part.

**Thoughts**: Again I spent most of the day outside, so I only did the 30 Days of Code on Hacker Rank.  

**Link to work:**  None
