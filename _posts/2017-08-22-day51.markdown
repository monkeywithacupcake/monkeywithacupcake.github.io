**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished the pomodoro timer for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). I'm frustrated that I killed the timer after I had it working, but then I fixed it again. It does not have all the functionality that I originally wanted, but I learned a bunch about timing, so I'm calling it good.  

**Thoughts**: There's so much more to learn!
