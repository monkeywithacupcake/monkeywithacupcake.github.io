**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished the Calculator for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). I'll start on the pomodoro app tomorrow.
+ Solved a quick graph algorithm on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com).
+ Made more progress on the instagram clone app that I'm making with [Code with Chris](https://codewithchris.com)

**Thoughts**: Getting started early and not spending all day mired in Hacker Rank algorithm incremental improvements certainly makes things faster
