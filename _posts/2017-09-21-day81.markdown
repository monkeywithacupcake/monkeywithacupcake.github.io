**Today's Progress**:
+ Improved speed and functionality of the travel app by loading up information in a different way and adding functions to the classes. Also added reverse geocoding. 

**Thoughts**:   I had some magical brain power today and figured out how to connect and improve a whole bunch of classes, so I went a little craxy creating classses and printing out different things. I'm going to have to refactor soon to clean it up.
