I had to completely undo the pagination of the log today. I am sad about this.

## Today's Progress
+ Refactored this log to not have collections or pages
+ Attempted to fix the small screen hamburger navigation.


## Thoughts  
**Two steps back** All of my coding today was basically to no end. I spent over an hour trying to make the navigation hamburger on small screens work for the log, but it still does not. I am going to need to spend more time understanding why. I also had to kill the pagination because I was doing something wrong with github. Blargh!
