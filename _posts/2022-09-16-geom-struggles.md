I'm making a lot of progress with geographic analysis, but I am learning by doing, and there is a lot of ugly that happens that way. 

I have figured out a few things, but many things are still eluding me. Most of the struggle feels like it is with the words - as in, I don't have the right technical vocabulary to ask or find existing answers for what I am trying to do. So, I am doing and then checking and then doing again. 

It is an interesting process. Unfortunately, I don't have the right knowledge framework to hang my learning on, so it is slow as I build it nail by nail.
