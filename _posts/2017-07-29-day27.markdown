**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 24 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved an algorithm, so my algorithm rank is now *36869*, better than yesterday (*38002*). 
+ Solved two of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges for [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org) - I'm currently on challenge 271.
+ Read more about static site generation and incorporating custom design into themes for jekyll 

**Thoughts**: I spent most of the day outside, so I felt a little rushed through the coding I wanted to do today. I'm happy that I got it done.
