Have you ever played Celeste? 

It is a beautiful 2D game where you are a girl who needs to get through or up a mountain, and along the way, you can collect strawberries. 

I love that the icon is a pixel strawberry. 

That icon sits in my task bar and sorta mocks me. It says, *"hey, look here. Here is a game you are bad at."*

And it is so right. I am bad at Celeste. I am pretty sure it took me several tries to get through the tutorial level, and I've been on the same level or part of a level for months. 

The game play is deceptively simple - character can jump, walk, run, and climb. The obstacles are mostly holes and spikes. But, you have to be extra creative and good at switching between jump and climb very early in the game. It is not for the feint of heart. 

Maybe by the time I read this again, I'll be a little further along.
