** A Poem to Past Me **

It doesn't matter  
The world won't shatter  
if you make a mistake  
that becomes the way  
it becomes the path  
there is no other now  
you will figure out how  
to move   
to continue  
in this chosen direction  
and look back with affection  
at the choices you made  
when you were afraid
