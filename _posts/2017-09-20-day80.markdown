**Today's Progress**:
+ I joined the #100DaysOfCode WakaTime group. Set up WakaTime for Brackets and Xcode. 
+ Spent a lot of time downloading and installing Xcode9 - again. I did this yesterday!
+ Revised Travel project to Xcode 9 - meant deleting and reinstalling pods
+ Connected up some calendar functionality

**Thoughts**:   I appreciate the community that I've met through the #100DaysOfCode project.
