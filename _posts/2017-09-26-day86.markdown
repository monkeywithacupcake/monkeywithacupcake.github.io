**Today's Progress**:
+ Changed the underlying Firebase data structure for the travel app to next items under trips. The new code is much faster.
+ Figured out how to create a new trip with a new person at the same time into firebase - where child thread was throwing an exception.
+ Created a day agenda that catches issues with the trip - this will be good on first view of the trip list, on print, for the warnings view, and also for the calendar view. 
+ Learned about Amazon serverless tech at Amazon Japan with WWC Tokyo

func saveNewTripToDatabase(name: String, uname: String){
        let dateString = String(describing: Date())
        let owner = String(describing: Auth.auth().currentUser!.uid)
        let key = ref.child("trips").childByAutoId().key
        let firstpersonkey = ref.child("trips").child(key).child("members").childByAutoId().key
        let trip = ["name": name,
                    "owner": owner,
                    "created": dateString,
                    "updated": dateString, // this next is what I was missing
                    "members": [firstpersonkey : ["userid": owner,
                                                  "name": uname]]] as [String : Any]
        let tripUpdates = ["/trips/\(key)": trip,
                           "/users/\(owner)/trips/\(key)/": true] as [String : Any]
       // ... error handling, delegate returns...

**Thoughts**:   Spent 30 minutes at Tully's just waiting on the simulator to launch - blargh!!! I can't wait for my ram to show up.
