Yes. Yes.

I am so glad that my friend nabbed tickets to see Black Violin when they were in Bremerton. 

What a joy to watch, listen, and experience.

I didn't find out until after the show that, of our group, I was the only one who **knew** Black Violin music before the concert. It must have been a true joy to be surprised by this vibrant pair. I had seen some folks in the audience who clearly go to symphony often who also did not expect this show. 

If you get a chance to see them, take it.

If you don't - 
Imagine that you are at a violin and viola duo concert, but it is fun. Okay, that's a Black Violin show. So much talent and enthusiasm.
