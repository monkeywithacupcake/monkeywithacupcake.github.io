Saw my tweet being excited about the Power to Choose repo in an email from Digital Ocean about Hacktoberfest, and I felt super famous for a second this morning. That was fun. 

Announced to the dog when discord broke and I had no one to type announce to, "Today is the day that I will reconfigure my 100 Days of Code log to have separate sections for each round....and maybe pages". But then, I failed to do it because I am getting a strange error where I get a header link for each page of the paginated section. 

## Today's Progress
+ I found a date time picker library on Github that looked much nicer than the default but would work for long periods. I submitted a pull request to allow showing the user the month in the date cards. I think it makes it easier to use.
+ I made the tiniest of progress on my Travel application by starting to hook up the "save edits to" and "save new" travel item. 
+ I futzed with the locales and datetime some more trying to understand how multiple time zone trips or travelling outside your time zone looks. I'm still not super sure.

## Thoughts  
**The Coding Community is Fun** I am enjoying interacting with people on twitter and github.

## Link to work
+ Woot PR [DateTimePicker PR](https://github.com/itsmeichigo/DateTimePicker/pull/45)
