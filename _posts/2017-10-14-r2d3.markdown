Saw my tweet being excited about the Power to Choose repo in an email from Digital Ocean about Hacktoberfest, and I felt super famous for a second this morning. That was fun. 

Announced to the dog when discord broke and I had no one to type announce to, "Today is the day that I will reconfigure my 100 Days of Code log to have separate sections for each round....and maybe pages"

## Today's Progress
+ I found a date time picker library on Github that looked much nicer than the default but would work for long periods. I submitted a pull request to allow showing the user the month in the date cards. I think it makes it easier to use.
