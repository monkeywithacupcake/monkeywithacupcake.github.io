Halloween! It's been a thrilling day (see what I did there?). Crushing It was welcomed to the Apple App Store, I resolved an issue with Firebase, and I uploaded a mostly non-working version of my Travel app to the App Store to begin device testing and get comfortable with the process. Version 1.0 (1).

## Today's Progress
+ I tested out some JSON codable and decodable code for reading in and managing my trip data. This is essential as I look for a potential alternate to using Firebase for my backend.
+ I recoded a table view as a collection view to make space between items. As a collection view, each item is like a card and appears more distinct. I like it.
+ I submitted my rewritten and nearly empty Travel application to iTunes Connect so that I can practice internal testing each build.
