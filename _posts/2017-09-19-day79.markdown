**Today's Progress**:
+ I corrected the map view to show the annotations in the right place. 
+ I added a transition to the maps app for directions from the user's current location
+ I added a new trip function
+ I tried to correct the transition to the tab view where the user sees the data right away, but it did not work.

**Thoughts**:  Little forward progress is still forward progress.

**Link to work**: None to show
