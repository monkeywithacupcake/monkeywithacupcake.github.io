Typhoon Lan came through very early this morning, so I started around 0300 (wind is loud). The afternoon was a little bumpy for mental capacity. I'm going to have to do better at taking breaks. A long walk in the sunshine after the storm was delightful, but not enough to help me feel recharged.

## Today's Progress

+ I nearly finished rebuilding Crushing it with no storyboard and in Swift 4. I created some pretty splash screens, too. Right now, I'm only using the aqua one, but I may set it up to save to use a different one based on the user chosen theme.

+ I'm trying to pick an app icon before I upload it to the app store. I'm torn between the following rough icons - need a little work before uploading regardless.

## Thoughts
**Storyboards are for the birds** After so many frustrations with the storyboard, I cannot believe how much easier it is to develop without them. I had previously built a very simple single view application without storyboards and had an idea of the way it could work. After building a simple app with React Native, I knew it could be done. I'm so happy to have an application that has multiple screens and custom views and still does not use the storyboard. It isn't fancy or anything, but it is mine. One thing that is eluding me is setting the navigation bar colors from the theme in the root view. I think I'm going to have to set up an actual root view that loads and have people swipe over to their goals. That way, the `Style.theme()` can be called before the navigation bar needs to load. 

## Links to Work
+ I did not publish any work today.
