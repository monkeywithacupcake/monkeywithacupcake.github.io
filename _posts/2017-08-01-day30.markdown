**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished *Day 27 of 30daysofCode* on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com). My algorithm rank today is *32,282*, a little better than yesterday *35,270* because I solved a couple of algorithms. I didn't work on the currently stuck problem to speed up a count of shifts in an insertion sort - I'm using a binary inversion tree but still timing out on some test cases.
+ Still can't do anything with [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) after whatever I did on Challenge 271. 
+ I finished moving the rest of my 100 Days of Code log from Github repo to this github.io site. 
+ Finally made progress with updating the css over a jekyll theme. Moved my 100 Days of Code log from Github repo to github.io site. I had been following different jekyll documentation on this for days and was going a little crazy. It turns out that I was very close. For minima, I needed to have a file called `assets/main.scss` in the base folder for the site, like the example below. Some documentation said it should be in `assets/css/` and others had other locations or said it should be .scss. It was all very frustrating. However, it works splendidly now. I will work on updating the footer next.

**Thoughts**: I wish my first try would work. 

**Link to work**: None - coding in swift today
