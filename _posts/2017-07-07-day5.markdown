**Today's Progress**: 
+ Changed several String data fields into enums to improve functionality in my iOS application and prevent crashes. Also added in some editing capability. I spent about 4 hours on revisions today, and the application backend is better for it. The front end still needs work. 
+ Finished **Day 2 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) and some other algorithm challenges. I ignored the video for Day 2 and just solved the problems. For all of them, I used python3.  My rank is now *355944*, so I think that means that I surpassed more than 100,000 people (*I was at 508575 yesterday*) for just solving a few simple problems today. 
+ Finished Chapter 3 of [Clean Code by Robert Martin](http://amzn.to/2sOXBuy). It was much better reading on the full laptop screen to absorb the functions. The second half of Chapter 3 discussion was difficult to me because it dealt with what would be returned as output from functions, and I’ve spent most of my time in code with data analysis. I have not had to deal with exceptions or a great deal of error handling. However, I caught a few poor code practices that I’ve done before - functions that have side effects is probably number one. Getting functions to the point where they do one thing and can be described in a to statement (first part of Chapter 3), will largely take care of this stuff. I have been keeping it in mind as I do challenges on Hacker Rank and work on the iOS application.
+ Worked on my Personal Portfolio sample page for  [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). I need to add a few links and it will be finished. 

**Thoughts**: I need to be diligent about code as I write it so that I can spend less time cleaning it later.
