**Today's Progress**:
+ I tried to pivot to reactjs. Completed a tutorial and read up on keys. 

**Thoughts**:  Shifting from swift to reactjs was hard on my brain, but I was able to make some connections. So many of these languages/ libraries have similar concepts. I hope that I can use react later for web apps and android apps. 

**Link to work**: none today
