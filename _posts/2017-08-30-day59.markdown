**Today's Progress**:
+ I set up another website and began developing the front-end. 
+ Continued to work on iOS - focused on gesture recognizers today. All of that work made me want to make a game. (not making a game)
 
**Thoughts**:   Even with all that I have learned, I feel nervous/uneasy about actually putting web content "out there".
