If you make an application use features that are only available from the current iOS, it is super a pain in the bootie to adjust to make it work on previous versions. In other news, I updated my iPhone to iOS 11 today.

## Today's Progress
+ I sent Crushing It to the App Store for Testing. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Ok, that action followed others.

+ I spent a few hours just fiddling with sound. I got the sound working, but I didn't like any of the sounds that I could find (I usually use apps silently). So, I commented out all of my sound code except to let the user play ambient sounds over my application.


## Thoughts  
**The business end of development** Coding and testing can be so fun, especially in the early days when major parts of an application are coming together. However, the last mile can be a heartache. There are dozens of little things to think about, like: color, sound, which screenshots are most helpful. Developing copy for the app store requires quite a bit of thought and (hopefully) a proofreader. Actual submission includes filling out forms, submitting license agreements, providing revew information, describing the application and features, creating an archive, tracking keys, etc.  

## Link to work
+ I'd love to link up the test version of Crushing It, but it won't be publicly available until I get through the gatekeepers.
