**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 22 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved some algorithms, so my algorithm rank is now *39542*, better than yesterday (*43393*). 
+ Solved three of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting for [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org) - I'm currently on challenge 264.
+ Read about static site generation [Brian Rinaldi's free O'Reilly book on Static Site Generation](http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/files/static-site-generators.pdf)
+ Read Ch 15 of Clean Code by Robert Martin - this chapter is on something called JUnit Internals. Either he didn't define it well, I didn't care, or some combination because I didn't get much out of it.  

**Thoughts**: I struggled a little today with writing code that was efficient (still). My first approach is still many loops or if/then. I am getting better at refactoring.   

**Link to work:**  None
