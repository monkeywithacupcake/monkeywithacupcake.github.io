**Today's Progress**:
+ iOS dev: I spent a few hours figuring out how to move an app from Xcode to testflight. Once I stopped trying to use Xcode 9 beta, everything was fine. 
+ iOS dev: playing with EventKit - I made a little calendar/reminder app

**Thoughts**:  I get very excited when there is a big step for a project. Today was one of those days, as I moved an app in development on my computer to the app store, even if just for internal testing.
