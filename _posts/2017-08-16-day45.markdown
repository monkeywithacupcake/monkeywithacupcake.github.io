**Today's Progress**:
+ Started the pomodoro timer for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
+ One algorithm down for [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) 
+ I made an imitation of my favorite planner for the daily css challenge today: calendar
+ Got past all of the logic for login/logout/update groups for iOS and firebase.

**Thoughts**: Some things are easy to do in CSS, and others make more sense with different programs.
