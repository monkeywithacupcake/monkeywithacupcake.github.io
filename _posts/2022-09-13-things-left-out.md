Today, on my bike ride home from work, I passed a white plastic chair. A part of me wanted to stop riding, dismount, and go and experience sitting in that chair in its current location. What if it were a profound experience? I don't know. I will likely never know. 

The chair was situated on the edge of the shoulder of the road. For context, it is a fairly busy road but not with pedestrians, and no public transit - like, no one is waiting for anything on this road. The chair was facing away from the road, towards some rather thick brambles and then forest. I can't imagine being able to observe anything from that vantage. 


I know for sure that the chair was not there yesterday - as I also biked past that spot yesterday, and I have a lot of time to observe the edge of the road while I am peddling up a long hill. 

Beyond thinking about what one might observe from that particular chair, it got me thinking about all the things that people leave behind. Like when you see a shoe or a jacket just waiting for its owner to come back. What stories do the people tell of the moment when they left that item? Are the stories exciting - _I was running from a bear, and my shoe came off, and I decided to leave it!_ or perhaps they are uncertain - _I thought I had my jacket; maybe I left it at the trailhead or beach, no...I definitely had it when we got fries. Wait, maybe that was the time before._ Do people successfully make it back to nab these lost items? Do others acquire them - **ah, my new lucky jacket!**

I don't know any of the answers, but I do like thinking about the questions.
