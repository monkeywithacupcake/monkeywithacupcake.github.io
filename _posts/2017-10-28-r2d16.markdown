Sometimes, the documentation isn't helpful, but the error message is. 

## Today's Progress
+ I made minor changes and resubmitted Crushing It to the app store - now version 1.5 - I'm learning so much about this process.
+ I made some major changes to how Travel Together manages maps. Also had a little fun completely revamping the Apple designed map sample app called "Tandm" - hehe.


## Thoughts  
**Errors** Today, I was excited to see my first app store submission available for beta testing and then sad to see a message saying that it was rejected by the app store. I didn't realize exactly how the whole process worked, but it turns out that submission for beta testing approval is separate from submission for the app store approval. Live and learn. It turned out that the issue was that I had alert controllers that appear in two places set to the .actionSheet style. In iPhone, this works fine, and defaults to an anchor at the bottom of the screen. In iPad, an action sheet must have a popover presentation conroller with an attached location, so it can pop out of the screen. The fix was one line of code. 
`alertController.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = soundButton`

## Link to work
