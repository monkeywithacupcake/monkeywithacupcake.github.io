I spent most of the day taking a trip to the National Museum of Western Art in Ueno - fun. I am happy that I was able to go. Some of the pieces were quite amazing. 

## Today's Progress
+ Made some progress on coding up JSON of some rhetoric memorization work that one of my kiddos needs to do. 

+ I figured made a bunch of reusable cards for different UIView needs, so that I can just program them in rather than recreate views all the time. Phew. So much better than storyboards!!

+ I finally simplified the programmatic anchors to stretch my stackviews to the view (or however I want) for both iOS11 and previous - this is the least amount of code I could come up with. 

{% highlight swift %}
//autolayout the stack view
let hSpacing: CGFloat = 8.0
let wSpacing = UIScreen.main.bounds.width/8
if #available(iOS 11.0, *) {
    let guide = self.view.safeAreaLayoutGuide
    stackView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.trailingAnchor, constant: -wSpacing).isActive = true
    stackView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.leadingAnchor, constant: wSpacing).isActive = true
    stackView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.topAnchor, constant: hSpacing).isActive = true
    stackView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.bottomAnchor, constant: -hSpacing).isActive = true
}
else {
    let margins = view.layoutMarginsGuide
    stackView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: margins.trailingAnchor, constant: -wSpacing).isActive = true
    stackView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: margins.leadingAnchor, constant: wSpacing).isActive = true
    stackView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: margins.topAnchor, constant: hSpacing).isActive = true
    stackView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: margins.bottomAnchor, constant: -hSpacing).isActive = true
}
{% endhighlight %}
