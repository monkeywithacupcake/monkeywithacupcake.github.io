**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 21 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved some algorithms, so my algorithm rank is now *43393*, better than yesterday (*49514*). 
+ Started the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting for [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org) - I'm currently on challenge 261.
+ Read Ch 14 of Clean Code by Robert Martin - this chapter is on code refinement. It is helpful-ish ...a long-cody explanation of how to improve code iteratively.  

**Thoughts**: I did a good job today of limiting the time spent on this.
