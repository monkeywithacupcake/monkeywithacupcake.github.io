**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 4 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) and some other algorithm challenges. I am still ignoring the videos for 30daysofcode. The challenge today was fun. I also solved some algorithms and some of the python section. My rank is now *245881*, still improving (*I was at 330072 yesterday*) for just solving a few problems today. I struggled a little today with algorithms because I did not write efficient processes. It was great to learn that it is faster to sort an array of strings than to convert to integer first. 
+ Made it through several of the Javascript challenges in [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). I’m currently at challenge 140. This feels like pretty good progress for Day 7. 
+ Read about [Initialization in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html). I think this structure is something that I am not doing very neatly in my iOS application, so I am trying to improve my understanding of how Swift deals with classes with custom v default initialization. I did not realize that you can defined several init() within a class or struct to initialize an instance in different ways. This significantly changes the way that I think I should structure at least one of the applications in my list of to-dos. I need to reread the section called “Setting a Default Property Value with a Closure or Function” because I am not quite sure how I can use this feature, but it seems the appropriate way to functionally set defaults. I sought out more ways that this idea can be referenced in the wild, and [Jordan Morgan’s discussion of Swift + Initialization with Closures](https://medium.com/the-traveled-ios-developers-guide/swift-initialization-with-closures-5ea177f65a5) brings up one way that you might do it and also another, uglier, but no ending () way.

**Thoughts**: I like solving algorithms with code, but I prefer to have real challenges.
