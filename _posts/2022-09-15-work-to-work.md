Do you ever get caught in a trap where you have project(s) that you want to work on but you are not sure where to start or what to do or you think maybe the idea will come to you?

**I do**

And I have to relearn fairly often that working on the projects helps me come up with ideas, identify the next steps, sometimes identify the steps I should have started with...and all of a sudden, I am moving forward.

I am not sure what makes this rule. Seems like a dumb rule - we should know where we are going before we start - but, alas, that's how it goes. 

So start. Start confused. Start scared. Do the work to do the work. 

_I'm out - in a rhythm on a project and I want to get back to it_
