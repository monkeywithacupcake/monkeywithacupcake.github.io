**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 23 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), and I solved some algorithms, so my algorithm rank is now *38002*, better than yesterday (*39542*). 
+ Solved four of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges for [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org) - I'm currently on challenge 269.
+ Created a page on github.io.  

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed spending a little time on getting my site up, and I was able to maintain some discipline and not continue to work on it even though it is not really ready.
