I got a bike locker today!

A few weeks ago, I did not know what a bike locker was. I hauled my bike up the elevator and down the hall and stashed it in a spare cubical. Every. Day. 

Now, I have a dry safe place to store my bike outside. 

It's weirdly still a little small for my bike. My small framed bike. The rear rack scrapes the sides. The handlebars barely fit. 

But, my bike is safely out of the rain and waiting for me at the end of the day. 

Does your workplace have secret bike lockers? Ask around.
