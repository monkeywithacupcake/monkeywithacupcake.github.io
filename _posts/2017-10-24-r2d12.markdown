Hooray for Women Who Code - I love the group in Tokyo. Everyone is so talented and focusing on different things. It is truly inspring to see that group of women in tech again. 

## Today's Progress

+ I updated the Crushing it app icon and created the settings view with images to allow users to adjust the application color easily. It took me a little while to realize that I could load the theme on the `Application Did Finish Loading ...` and not have to wait until `View Did Load`. This is important because the root view does not finish loading the theme before its navigation bar is loaded.
