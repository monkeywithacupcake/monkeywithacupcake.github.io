**Today's Progress**: 
+ Started challenges on  [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com). Started working through Algorithms challenge and signed up for the Moody’s Women in Engineering Hackathon later this month…somehow also started 30 days of code on Hacker Rank, so my #daysofcode are not in sync.
+ Set up an account on Packt to access free ebooks for learning and improving skills. Today was HTML5 and CSS
+ Finished Chapter 2 of [Clean Code by Robert Martin](http://amzn.to/2sOXBuy). So obvious, but I found this statement in Clean Code to be profound, “If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.”
+ Finished Responsive Design with Bootstrap and jQuery sections on  [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). I’ll be starting on the “Build a Tribute Page” task tomorrow. 
+ Set up a [Code Pen](codepen.io) account. 
+ Joined [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com) which I’m pretty sure is part of [GitHub](https://github.com/). To be honest, I’m not really sure what I’m going to do with this; however, I do think that my GitHub skills are not super great (I forget and have to look up the verbs - push, pull, etc.) and could be improved by having more contributions. 
+ Worked on changing the design pattern in my travel iOS application. It is getting a little unwieldy. After breaking the whole application again, I stopped to review some other developer approaches to their problems. 

**Thoughts**: There appear to be many related things to join and set up to properly participate in the 100 Days of Code
