I ran into a Firebase wall today as I can build and test Travel Together all day, but I cannot archive it. 

## Today's Progress
+ I revised Crushing It to be backwards compatible to 10.3. The swipe left and right functionality is new with iOS11, but users on previous versions could already swipe to delete. I added an `@available(iOS11.0, *)` check before the new functions. Also, the top label of a stacked table cell did not appear in iOS 10.3 until I added a `tableView?.estimatedRowHeight = 100`. I think it may have had a default that was too small and just cut off the text.
+ I resubmitted build 2 of version 1.4 and discontinued review of version 1.5. I'm not really sure what I am doing here, but I re-read the documentation, and I'm pretty sure that is what I was supposed to do in the first place.
+ I updated the pods and attempted to upload Travel Together for testing
+ I restarted TravelTogether as a Storyboard free application


## Thoughts  
**BLARGH!** Just when things seem to be making sense, something comes along that I know nothing about, like why can my project find a library when I run it but not when I archive it. I tried everything I could find on stack overflow and finally submitted a help request to Firebase.
