**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 10 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com). I did not solve any algorithms today, so my algorithm rank is now *128046*, which is worse than yesterday (*127846*).
+ Did a Basic Algorithm Scripting challenge in [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). Iâ€™m currently at challenge 245. The challenge that I did was just filtering for falsy in javascript. Combining boolean with filter method for array makes filtering falsy values from an array cake: ```new = arr.filter(Boolean)```

**Thoughts**: I barely spent my hour coding today, and I did not accomplish much. It was a full and lovely day, but not a coding one. I'm okay with that. 

**Link to work:** None
