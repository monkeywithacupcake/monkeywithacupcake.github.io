**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 12 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com), but I did not solve any other algorithms today, so my algorithm rank is now *83151*, which is worse than yesterday (*83041*).
+ Completed the JSON API and Ajax challenges in [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). Iâ€™m currently at challenge 255.  
+ Fixed all of the items that I set out to fix to improve my iOS application to track different "hats" that we wear. 

**Thoughts**: I am looking forward to getting my DUNS number, so I can beta test my apps with other users. I was able to crush the challenge on classes today, and I attribute that to the practice that I've had with python lately. 

**Link to work:** None
