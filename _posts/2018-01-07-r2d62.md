I'm testing in mocha...I think but then, go and look at jQuery Chai testing? I don't understand all these fancy coffee/tea shop names for testing. Here's a reference to [Chai JS testing words](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery) for later.
 - update: learned that mocha is the thing that does the testing and chai is the way that we spec out our test 
 - comment: I'm sure that this is a gross simplification, and it doesn't address all the other weird coffee names out there. 

## Today's Progress
+ Worked on Udemy test course. Big learn - when writing tests, focus on the output. That way, when you refactor the code, it won't throw up errors when the output is still what you want. 
+ Made a few test web applications. That was fine. Now, what if I want to put these on the web? I own some domains, and I have a hosting service, but I couldn't figure out what I should upload. So, there are definitely some holes in my understanding. I shall be patient. 
+ Made the tiniest of updates to my travel app - now end time is showing properly for things that have end times. Woot. 

## Thoughts  
**There is always more to learn** 
**Goals** I think I will port this log over to my blog and make coding a section or 100DaysOfCode at least. I don't like being so, so, sliced up. 

## Link to work
+ Well, I was going to put a test application out there, but I need to figure out how to do that. bummer.
