Last night, the hubs and I were doing laps around the pool table. Like, literally just walking around it - as it is the only place to make a convenient circle in the house. 

We have been so cooped up since the snow has made the last mile (between our front door and...anywhere you might want to go) treacherous. We both decided to get in a little more movement. I got well over a thousand steps just walking in circles, so, I guess it worked! Movement is movement. It started simple enough - just walking. Then, it turned into a slow race. Then, it turned into a game with changing directions and fast breaks. We were having so much fun that one of the kiddos came out to complain about the noise! 

It reminded me of a winter years ago - must have been 2014 or 2015? We both had some kind of step tracking watches for the first time, or the step tracking watches had challenges for the first time. Either way, we had recently started to compete for **the most steps** every day. We'd be walking extra steps around the house whenever we were doing anything. I've always been more of an early-to-bed, early-to-rise sort, so I'd work hard to get a lead before I went to bed. Then, he'd walk around the living room while watching TV after I went to bed, just to whatever I had + a few steps. He giggled about those laps around the couch being valuable. 

I'd much rather be getting my movement from running down the road or trails, but I'm glad that we can still have fun and exercise very mildly with this weather.

Now that I say all of that, I think that there are probably more efficient ways to exercise at home - we could have done yoga routines or lifted weights. However, my watch doesn't tell me how much of *that* I've done. Thinking about this gets me down a whole other path of what is measured and how it impacts our choices, so I'm going to stop here for now. I think it is time for coffee, anyways.
