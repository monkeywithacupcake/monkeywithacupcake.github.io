**Today's Progress**:
+ Progressed on Advanced Front End Algorithms on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com); now I am on challenge 283. 
+ I broke 20k! My [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) algorithm rank today is *19,717*, a little better than yesterday (*20,953*) because I solved a few algorithms. 
+ I did the second Pure CSS image challenge. I actually got the email with the image last night, but I've decided that it makes more sense to do it the next day than late at night.
+ Made it further through iOS / Firebase tutorial Photo App with [Code with Chris](https://www.codewithchris.com)  - basically an instagram clone. Still haven't gotten to the part I need to see, but the profile page development was helpful for thinking about setting up user settings. 

**Thoughts**: It is easy to lose time when working on challenging but iterable problems.
