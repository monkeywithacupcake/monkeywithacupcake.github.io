## Today's Progress
+ I started building a website for my awesomely talented kiddo. I'm trying to make it a little artsy, but I hope to pass it off to him and he can maintain it. Not finished yet.

+ I spent some time in swift playgrounds figuring out how to do a few things programmatically without the storyboard. I created my first Gist with this. It inclues: creating a stack view, creating a collection view that is horizontal only, and using unicode characters as graphics.

+ Contributed to the repo for [If you know X then Y](https://github.com/GersonLazaro/learn-x-if-you-know-y) 

## Thoughts  
**Brain dead today** Static sites are fun.
