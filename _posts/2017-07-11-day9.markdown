**Today's Progress**:
+ Finished **Day 6 of 30daysofCode** on [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) and some other algorithm challenges. I am still ignoring the videos for 30daysofcode. The challenge today was much simpler than I thought at first, just printing indexed strings - still fun. I also solved some more algorithms. My algorithm rank is now *174380*, still improving (*I was at 196737 yesterday*) for just solving a few problems today. 
+ Read the 100daysofcode Github repo and realized that the rules are different than what I had thought. ~I am going to start working on a twitter bot for fun and to meet the goal of having a real challenge.~ And now I have a twitter bot up and running - I really thought that would take more than an hour. I’m pretty excited to have gotten it working. You can see the [public GitHub repo for the Pink Fairy Bot](https://github.com/monkeywithacupcake/pinkfairy-twitterbot), the [@PinkFairyBook twitter profile](https://twitter.com/PinkFairyBook), or interact with it using the hashtag “#PinkFairyBook” on twitter. Hopefully my computer will be running, and you will get a response. **Next: I will figure out how to make it work from not my laptop.**
+ Made it through several of the Javascript challenges in [Free Code Camp]( https://www.freecodecamp.org). I’m currently at challenge 201.  Javascript and its required semi-colons makes me thankful that R and python do not require semi-colons. I’m not sure that I would have loved programming for data analysis if I had to always remember to add them. 
+ Completed some Swift modules at [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com) 

**Thoughts**: Lessons/tutorials/modules in Swift have been pretty helpful for me to get more comfortable with the language.  I wish I had done this before I started coding apps. Better late than never, right!
