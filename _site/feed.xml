&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts&quot;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two steps back&lt;/strong&gt; All of my coding today was basically to no end. I spent over an hour trying to make the navigation hamburger on small screens work for the log, but it still does not. I am going to need to spend more time understanding why. I also had to kill the pagination because I was doing something wrong with github. Blargh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had a bit of an aha moment when struggling with some firebase edits. I can create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[String: Bool]&lt;/code&gt; dictionary with a loop if I don’t try to append. I had been trying to append and losing my mind. Then, I can upload to firebase by just including: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;going&quot; : goingdict&lt;/code&gt; for example rather than writing it all out. I’m super excited about this. Of course, this example is trivial, but it has implications for the rest of my writing to firebase challenges. Especially when just trying to include a list of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;goingdict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;goingdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;personid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I solved the issue that I had with the jekyll pagination and then spent some time reconfiguring this log&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TFW your PR is merged&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think it ever gets old. I love contributing. Also, a twitter-er and I discussed the possibility of a Chrome extension to let you know exactly when this happens. I’m not sure yet how to implement because (1) I’ve never created a Chrome extension and (2) I’m not sure that Chrome can “listen” for change in state to the github API. I think there is a call limit. However, I’m going to investigate this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;I found a date time picker library on Github that looked much nicer than the default but would work for long periods. I submitted a pull request to allow showing the user the month in the date cards. I think it makes it easier to use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made the tiniest of progress on my Travel application by starting to hook up the “save edits to” and “save new” travel item.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I futzed with the locales and datetime some more trying to understand how multiple time zone trips or travelling outside your time zone looks. I’m still not super sure.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;todays-progress&quot;&gt;Today’s Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made some progress on an instagram clone app, but I got stuck because of a change in the way that data needed to be stored threw off some earlier functions to retrieve and store data in firebase. I spent too much time on it to continue today, but this will require refactoring. This is one of the reasons that I get frustrated with the concepts of the nosql databases - because we then repeat data in multiple locations to improve speed for users…which means that changes to the structure of one thing can cascade.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated pods and cleaned out the build on my travel application. I just learned recently that you can use the Product menu to select “Clean” and then use the Option button to select “Clean Build Folder” which will get rid of all the old junk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forgot that I had ended on building out the Travel Item view in more detail (in the detail view controller) when I was working on the travel app last time, so I was completely surprised by the fails that I was getting because I chad not created the tet fields yet in the storyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changed the date pickers to be datetime pickers. I tried to set the end date picker to have the minimum date set to the maximum of either today, the start date from the item (existing), or the selected start date. While my log statements suggest that the logic was working correctly to identify the latest of these date times, the end time datepicker still started at now. I will have to revisit this. I think it will be frustrating to be planning a trip in the future and always have to scroll to the future date. Even a few months of scrolling is annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added the people back to the application. I had moved them from their own dictionary to part of the trip and then commented out all of the class related to them, so no people were showing up. This has been corrected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tested out regions to see how the datepicker and calendar respond. When changing the region and language nothing happens as long as the Calendar remains Gregorian. However, a shift to a Japanese calendar breaks the application - it does not “crash”, but the dates are wrong in the trip list, showing as year 4005 and out of order.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a mini button within the main trip table view that will allow the user to click through to trip warnings instead of the trip if the trip has warnings. Changed the existing warnings label to a button and added a delegate from the tableview cell back to the main listview. It was easier than I thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts&quot;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline First&lt;/strong&gt; This morning, I saw a twitter post about offline first development and how most developers didn’t really plan for it. Of course, recognizing myself in this, I followed some links and did a few searches and read some things. I’m not entirely sure, but I think that I have offline support for my data driven applications that use firebase based on the firebase documentation, but I will need to refactor my application to actually benefit. I also learned that firebase came out with another database platform that will be better for nested applications. The comparison shows that they have not only different structures but also different price bases: &lt;a href=&quot;https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/rtdb-vs-firestore&quot;&gt;Firebase Realtime Database v Firestore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my exploration of offline first, I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techbeacon.com/offline-first-web-mobile-apps-top-frameworks-components&quot;&gt;fantastic short list&lt;/a&gt; of options. I briefly considered learning how to use ionic and angular after reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ionic.io/building-an-ionic-app-with-offline-support-part-1/&quot;&gt;Building An Ionic App with Offline Support&lt;/a&gt;. I like the way that it uses SQL structure because NOSQL is breaking my brain. I also considered using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.4/installation/ios/index.html&quot;&gt;couchbase&lt;/a&gt; because the syntax is similar to what I’ve started with firebase and I can relate to the conceptuatl approach. However, I’m trying to stay disciplined and finish the items in my todo list before stepping out for the next shiny thing. I put them on my “to check out” list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to clean?&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not super sure when we need to clean, but I think it makes sense to do it after each pod update or other change that might impact the build library. I don’t know. Stuff like this really seems to be missing from guidance on developing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing&lt;/strong&gt; I want progress to happen faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DateStorage&lt;/strong&gt; In swift, when you &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;let dateString = String(describing: Date())&lt;/code&gt;, the output is always in GMT, or +0000. This is important because you need to remember to keep the calendar locale in mind and transitions to/from the GMT.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m a little bummed that the Power to Choose repo that I’m contributing to is not going to follow my suggestion of creating classes for offers that will include data on the tariff and link, but I still want to help. I guess it is back to making equations.&lt;/p&gt;

What can you do in 100 days? The answers are limitless. Committing to 100 days of code was great for both my coding and my larger self.  I never set out to be a developer or master any platform, but I wanted to have the skills to solve problems that I knew existed. Unfortunately, I didn’t know where to start to get those skills. Where were they hiding? Behind what wall, encoded in which language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started the 100 Days of Code, I was familiar with HTML and CSS, maintained a few websites, had created a few applications in python and R (mostly for data fetching, processing, and viewing), and had dipped my toe into swift because I had a “great app idea” to solve a problem. Now, I’m confident that I can solve a few problems in a few languages, and I know enough to not bite off some problems. I understand how some of the ecosystem of web services and mobile applications work. I am still aware that there are languages I haven’t touched and may not. &lt;em&gt;It’s as if I can see my little mountains and valleys more clearly, but I also know that the world is bigger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of July, I was big-eyed and ready to learn a thousand things. I had unreasonable expectations for my ability to climb up the learning curve and develop new applications. I stumbled onto the #100DaysOfCode community. Looking back, I’m so happy that I did. I’ve learned a ton, and I’ve met some great people (online and in person). One hundred days later, I wanted to be in a different place, but I’m happy that I took the path that I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can list many of the things that I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;brushed up and modernized my HTML and css game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coded over a dozen iOS applications based on instructions/tutorials/workbooks to gain skills in swift&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developed 2 complete iOS applications from my own ideas (2 are headed to appstore once I convert to Swift 4 and prepare for iOS11)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Crushing It” allows simple tracking of things you want to repeatedly do&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“My Hats” tracks all the different roles we might have at a given time (boards and what not)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;made substantial progress on a group travel iOS application also my own idea
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Travel Together” is a trip organizer that allows you and your friends to collaborate on trip planning and see your trips in space (map), time (calendar), by type (filterable agenda) and to track who paid for what to divvy up the costs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;began a quiz application that is timed to match the curriculum for my kids’ schoolwork including: Latin, geography, science, catechism, and grammar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;progressed up from about rank 500K to about 11K in Hacker Rank&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learned about a bunch of algorithms to speed up search and sort functions in python3 and javascript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encountered pre-processors:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;fell in love with the pug preprocessor for HTML&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adapted to SCSS for css&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;stumbled through and eventually understood babel for js&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;earned the front-end developer certificate from free code camp, including creating several little web applications in codepen (that I should revisit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;braved the terminal, practicing creating and opening files and conducting simple tasks with bash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;swam in the sea of extensions/frameworks available via cocoapods, npm, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learned how to use javascript to create interactive applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expanded my fledgling js skills with reactjs and other libraries - even building 4 test mobile applications with reactnative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learned how to use jekyll
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;transferred my blog from wordpress to jekyll (deleted almost everything in the process)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;created my 100 Days of Code log in jekyll&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;developed two more websites in jekyll&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;made substantial progress in understanding and actually using git for projects and interacting on github&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;created a twitterbot in python&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;completed an Amazon Serverless workshop and built a tutorial Alexa skill for a simulated IoT device&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;made my first pull requests on public repos using github to start contributing to the open source community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s probably a fairly complete list. However, it shows one of the characteristics of my 100DaysOfCode that was probably not ideal: I was ALL OVER THE PLACE. It’s my nature to be this way. I’ve always wanted to do everything and do it all right now. I don’t recommend following such a haphazard path. There’s always another shiny thing. It may even be a better shiny thing. Following one path is beneficial, though, because it is easier to look back on completed work and understand how all the parts fit together. One of the things that I enjoyed most was when I finished my first application for iOS from my own head using swift and was able to run it on my phone. It was pretty simple, but it incorporated things that I had learned from several places and was a complete product. I could not have made it to that feeling, that reward, without focusing for days on just one particular part of one language for one platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, and perhaps because I started out so ignorant, I benefitted a little from bouncing around because struggling with the semantics of a new language helped me to understand more of the fundamentals of things that I had somehow picked up along the way as practice without truly grasping the foundations. I’ll not lie - some of the foundations still evade me. I don’t know what they are, or I’d just loook them up. Some things evolved over time - I did not truly grasp classes until about day 80, but I’ve been using them. I still get nervous when trying to update my fork of a repo on github thinking I’ll break everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what I did and learned does not quite fit neatly on the list, like making mental connections between different processes, comparing and contrasting the amount of code required to do different tasks by language, learning the discipline of writing less crappy code, etc. That last one is a bugger, but important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there’s a whole other laundry list of coding-adjacent things that must be done - creating or finding graphics, choosing color palettes, choosing and applying fonts, understanding how changes in development cycles for hardware and software impact your code delivery, etc. The coding-adjacent set also includes figuring out how to publish and share your work. Developing mobile or Alexa applications requires getting in the respective app stores as a developer. There are surprisingly few places in this great big web that explain what that means and all the steps that an independent developer will need to pass through. The lifecycle of an application is not just coding its features, but cleaning it up, correctly formatting the meta-data, thinking through example/dummy test cases that you can share with reviewers, maintaining version control, and following up on minor changes in source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this journey, I’ve found that &lt;strong&gt;the community is the best part&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, committing to do something for 100 days is great, and actually following through yields results. That’s the premise behind the P90X workout system, right? However, the community is the best. I love the engagement on twitter. Everyone is friendly and encouraging. It’s truly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, I am going to do another round. This time, I’m going to focus on a few specific goals. In the next 100 days (by Jan 18), I will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finish, beta test, and launch the Travel Together iOS application (swift)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finish the refactor for and launch the other two iOS applications that I made (swift)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finish the school quiz application for iOS and android (reactnative) that I’ve planned out but not coded, beta test, and launch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IFF I get past those, I will look at my long list of “like to dos” and see what happens.&lt;/li&gt;

Committing to 100 days of code was great for both my coding and my larger self. I never set out to be a developer or master any platform, but I wanted to have the skills to solve problems that I knew existed. Unfortunately, I didn’t know where to start to get those skills. Where were they hiding? Behind what wall, encoded in which language?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 100 of 100 Days of Code</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/100daysofcode/day100.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 100 of 100 Days of Code" /><published>2017-10-10T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2017-10-10T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/100daysofcode/day100</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/100daysofcode/day100.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today’s Progress&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changed the underlying Firebase data structure for the travel app to next items under trips. The new code is much faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figured out how to create a new trip with a new person at the same time into firebase - where child thread was throwing an exception.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a day agenda that catches issues with the trip - this will be good on first view of the trip list, on print, for the warnings view, and also for the calendar view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learned about Amazon serverless tech at Amazon Japan with WWC Tokyo&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I completed a tutorial test of a react quiz application (for web)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I played with create react native apps using the evol application - very neat. I followed the facebook tutorial and started changing out options as I figured out what the components were.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I began a quiz application for my kiddos in create react native for iOS and Android.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made some progress on the travel application, but a few steps back as well because it currently does not compile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tested out FSCalendar and paper onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;:   I forgot to post updates day 83 and 84 (over the weekend). Life goes on. I really lost my patience with Xcode9 over the past few days. It keeps hanging on everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another #100DaysOfCode coder and I are brainstorming on how to make the leaderboard work. I think we can make a twitterbot, but I’m not sure where to host it. My current twitterbot is hosted on my computer, but I do not always have it connected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Shifted from Swift 3 to Swift 4. It was a bit of a struggle to get Xcode to play along.&lt;/li&gt;
