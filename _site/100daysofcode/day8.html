    <p><strong>Today’s Progress</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finished <strong>Day 5 of 30daysofCode</strong> on <a href="http://www.hackerrank.com">Hacker Rank</a> and some other algorithm challenges. I am still ignoring the videos for 30daysofcode. The challenge today was fun. I also solved some algorithms and some of the python section. I realize that the ranks are different by track; the ranks that I have been looking at are for the algorithm track - My algorithm rank is now <em>245881</em>, still improving (<em>I was at 245881 yesterday</em>) for just solving a few problems today. I checked out the functional programming track today, but I did not get very far because I was not familiar with any of the languages. I tried Haskell, but I was frustrated that things that seem obvious to me in other languages did not work. I’d like to try this again another time, but I first need to get more solid in programming with Java and Swift to meet some intermediate goals.</li>
  <li>Read Ch 5 of <a href="http://amzn.to/2sOXBuy">Clean Code by Robert Martin</a>. I enjoyed this chapter on formatting, probably because I felt that this is the part of clean code that I have right - thank you python craziness and R teachers. Since python will explode if you have spacing off and R can get difficult to discuss with colleagues if you can’t read functions, I’m already practicing good formatting. Now, I just need to do a better job of naming, writing methods, and not commenting. Seems doable.</li>
  <li>Made it through several of the Javascript challenges in <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a>. I’m currently at challenge 162.  This feels like pretty good progress for Day 8, but it also feels a little like procrastinating because these challenges are simple. I know they will get harder and more useful, but now I’m not getting it.</li>
  <li>Discovered that <a href="https://www.sololearn.com">Sololearn</a> - where I’ve been using the code editor to test my python code for HackerRank challenges also has courses - I guess that whole “learn” part of the name makes more sense now. I started the Swift course. Although I started at the beginning, and I already know some of this stuff, I think that it will be valuable to ensure I have the basics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: I’m missing something with Swift, and I think it is because I did not come from a C, Objective C, or Java background.</p>

<p><strong>Link to work</strong>: No new work today</p>
